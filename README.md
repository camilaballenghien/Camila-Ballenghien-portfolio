# [Project 1: Dice rolling simulator](https://github.com/camilaballenghien/Assignments-wk1-/blob/main/simul.ipynb)
The goal of this project involves writing a program that simulates rolling a dice. When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6. The program will print what that number is. It will then ask the user if they'd like to roll again.
- Used Python package Random
- Set minimum to 1 and Max to 6

# [Project 2: Guess the Number](https://github.com/camilaballenghien/Assignments-wk1-/blob/main/guessnum.ipynb) 
This project uses the random module in Python. This program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what the number is. (In other words, the user needs to be able to input information.) If the user's guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication will appear. I implemented functions to check if the user input is an actual number, to se the difference between the inputted number and the radomly generated numbers.
- Random function
- While loops
- If/Else statements
- Input/Output
- Variables
- Integers 
- Try/Except statements 
- Integers

# [Project 3: Madlibs generator](https://github.com/camilaballenghien/Assignments-wk1-/blob/main/madlibsgenerator.ipynb)
This program will first prompt the user for a series of inpts a la Mad Libs. For example, a singlar noun, an adjective, etc. Then, once all the information has been inputted, the program will take that data and place them into a premade story template. 
- Strings
- Variables 
- Concatenation
- Print

# [Project 4: Adventure game](https://github.com/camilaballenghien/Assignments-wk2/blob/main/Assignment%204.ipynb)
This program is a complete text game, the program will let users move through rooms based on user input and get descriptions
of each room. To create this, I established the direction in which the user can move, a way to track how far the user has moved (and therefore which room he/she is in), and to print out a description. I also set limits for how far the user can move. In other words, create “walls” around the rooms that tell the user, “You can’t move further in this direction.”
- Strings
- Variables
- Input/Output
- If/Else Statements
- Print
- List
- Integers
- Classes

# [Project 5: Data Visualisation Assignment](https://github.com/camilaballenghien/Assignment_wk3/blob/main/Assignment5.ipynb) 
This program demonstrates uses a Kaggle dataset (Earthquake dataset) and demonstrates my abilities with the package Matplotlib. 
I produced at least one of the following: 
- Bar Graph
- Pie Chart
- Box plot
- Line Chart
- Scatter Plot 

I also produced a heatmap demonstrating areas with earthquakes that have the highest magnitudes as shown below:
