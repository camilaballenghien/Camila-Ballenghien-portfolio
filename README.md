# [Project 1: Dice rolling simulator](https://github.com/camilaballenghien/Assignments-wk1-/blob/main/simul.ipynb)
The goal of this project involves writing a program that simulates rolling a dice. When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6. The program will print what that number is. It will then ask the user if they'd like to roll again.
- Used Python package Random
- Set minimum to 1 and Max to 6

# [Project 2: Guess the Number](https://github.com/camilaballenghien/Assignments-wk1-/blob/main/guessnum.ipynb) 
This project uses the random module in Python. This program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what the number is. (In other words, the user needs to be able to input information.) If the user's guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication will appear. I implemented functions to check if the user input is an actual number, to se the difference between the inputted number and the radomly generated numbers.
- Random function
- While loops
- If/Else statements
- Input/Output
- Variables
- Integers 
- Try/Except statements 
- Integers

# [Project 3: Madlibs generator](https://github.com/camilaballenghien/Assignments-wk1-/blob/main/madlibsgenerator.ipynb)
This program will first prompt the user for a series of inpts a la Mad Libs. For example, a singlar noun, an adjective, etc. Then, once all the information has been inputted, the program will take that data and place them into a premade story template. 
- Strings
- Variables 
- Concatenation
- Print

# [Project 4: Adventure game](https://github.com/camilaballenghien/Assignments-wk2/blob/main/Assignment%204.ipynb)
This program is a complete text game, the program will let users move through rooms based on user input and get descriptions
of each room. To create this, I established the direction in which the user can move, a way to track how far the user has moved (and therefore which room he/she is in), and to print out a description. I also set limits for how far the user can move. In other words, create “walls” around the rooms that tell the user, “You can’t move further in this direction.”
- Strings
- Variables
- Input/Output
- If/Else Statements
- Print
- List
- Integers
- Classes

# [Project 5: Data Visualisation Assignment](https://github.com/camilaballenghien/Assignment_wk3/blob/main/Assignment5.ipynb) 
This program demonstrates uses a Kaggle dataset (Earthquake dataset) and demonstrates my abilities with the package Matplotlib. 
I produced at least one of the following: 
- Bar Graph
- Pie Chart
- Box plot
- Line Chart
- Scatter Plot 

I also produced a geographical heatmap demonstrating areas with earthquakes that have the highest magnitudes as shown below:

# [Project 6: Logistic regression with Titanic dataset](https://github.com/camilaballenghien/Logistic-Regression/blob/main/titanic_assessment.ipynb)
This program uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It includes data exploratory analysis to find meaningful correlation and logistic regression using the sklearn package 
- Numpy 
- Pandas
- SKlearn 
- Logistic Regression
- ROC curve
- AUC 

# [Project 7: Neural Networks with Bank Churn modeling dataset](https://github.com/camilaballenghien/Bank-churn-Modeling-Artificial-Neural-Networks-project/blob/main/Neural_Supervised.ipynb)
This program uses a Churn modeling dataset from Kaggle, it predicts using different variables whether a customer will exit the bank or not. 
- Seaborn
- Neural networks 
- ROC curve 
- Confusion matrix
- AUC 
- F1 Score 
- Tensorflow

# [Project 8: Supervised Machine Learning project: Mushroom dataset](https://github.com/camilaballenghien/Supervised-machine-learning-project-Mushroom-dataset/blob/main/mushrooms.ipynb)
This dataset contains information on a number of mushrooms, as well as a label indicating if
they are poisonous or not. This program uses mushroom characteristics to predict whether a mushroom is poisonous or not. 
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Pandas
- SKlearn
- AUC
- ROC curve

# [Project 9: Unsupervised Machine Learning Project: Country data for charity](https://github.com/camilaballenghien/Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-project-Using-K-Means/blob/main/country_data.ipynb) 
The dataset used (from kaggle) contains socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of countries. The purpose of the dataset is to help a charity fighting poverty to identify groups of countries where it is needed most. This program groups together countries in clusters depending on how much help they need.
- K means
- Seaborn
- SKlearn
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Plotly

The geographical map below is the result of the clustering:

# [Project 10: Final project: Anime recommendation system](https://github.com/camilaballenghien/Anime-Recommendation-Engine/blob/main/2nd_Draft.ipynb)
This program is the final project of 2022 Data Science Bootcamp. It consists of a Hybrid Recommendation system for animes. I combined an item based recommendation engine and collaborative filtering into my final recommendation system. 
- PCA 
- K-means
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- Numpy
- TF-IDF (Text Frequence Inverse Document Frequency)
- Count Vectorizer 
- Cosine Similarity
- WordCloud

It uses 2 different datasets from Kaggle. One dataset contains, the synopsis of the anime, genre, score etc. The second dataset contains anime ID, User ID, and the score each user has given to each anime. These datasets contain recommendation data from 320.0000 users and 16.000 animes at myanimelist.net
