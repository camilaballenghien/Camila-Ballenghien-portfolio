# [Project 1: Dice rolling simulator](https://github.com/camilaballenghien/Assignments-wk1-/blob/main/simul.ipynb)
The goal of this project involves writing a program that simulates rolling a dice. When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6. The program will print what that number is. It will then ask the user if they'd like to roll again.
- Used Python package Random
- Set minimum to 1 and Max to 6

# [Project 2: Guess the Number](https://github.com/camilaballenghien/Assignments-wk1-/blob/main/guessnum.ipynb) 
This project uses the random module in Python. This program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what the number is. (In other words, the user needs to be able to input information.) If the user's guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication will appear. I implemented functions to check if the user input is an actual number, to se the difference between the inputted number and the radomly generated numbers.
